Vim Configuration

Use `plug` to manage plugins. The installed plugins see `plugins.vim`, the keybinds see `keybindings.vim`.

To exec `shell ./install.sh` to install.

But before installing, you should install the dependencies, such as: python-dev, clang-dev, pkg-config and so on.

The `ycm` configure file after installed is `~/.vim/datas/ycm_extra_conf.py`, you can custom it to configure `c/c++` completions.
